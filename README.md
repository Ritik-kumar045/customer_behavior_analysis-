📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Pipeline
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from loading and cleaning raw data to generating insights using SQL and visualizing results in Power BI.
It also includes documentation and a final presentation designed using Gamma.
The goal is to showcase strong skills in Python, SQL, BI reporting, and analytics storytelling.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is loaded into Python for initial exploration.

It contains information relevant for business analysis (e.g., sales, customers, operations, etc.).

Format: CSV

Size: Varies depending on the use case.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI for dashboard development

Gamma for creating the final PPT

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for Python development


🧾 Steps Followed
1️⃣ Load Data

Imported dataset using Python (pandas.read_csv).

Checked first few rows, column types, and missing values.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, std, correlations).

Distribution analysis using histograms and box plots.

Identified outliers and patterns.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using imputation.

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.

Fixed inconsistent formats (dates, categories, strings).

Created new calculated fields when required.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Wrote queries for:

Filtering and grouping

Joins and aggregations

Window functions

KPI extraction (sales, revenue, customers, etc.)

Exported results for visualization.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected SQL dataset to Power BI.

Built interactive visuals:

KPI cards

Bar charts / Line charts

Filters & slicers

Drill-down views

Designed a clean, business-friendly dashboard layout.

6️⃣ Report Creation

Summarized insights into key findings.

Documented business recommendations.

Shared visual results and SQL outputs.

7️⃣ Presentation Using Gamma

Transformed the report into a professional PPT.

Added visuals, KPIs, and insights.

Designed for a non-technical audience.

📈 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trends and patterns

Category-wise and time-based breakdown

Insights that support data-driven decision-making

✅ Results

Extracted meaningful insights from raw data.

Improved data quality through cleaning and preprocessing.

Created useful SQL queries for analytical reporting.

Delivered a professional BI dashboard and presentation.

Demonstrated strong end-to-end data analytics capabilities.
